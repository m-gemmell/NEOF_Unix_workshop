## Acquiring Workshop data

The first step to carry out is to copy the data for the workshop to your home directory.

### Changing directories
Before copying you will change directory to your home directory.

- `cd` is the command to Change Directory. It is followed by the directory you want to change to.
- __"\~"__ represents your home directory.

Change directory to your home directory by running the following command in your terminal:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd ~ 
``` 

In Linux the default of `cd` is to change directory to your home directory. Therefore the following command will do the same as the above.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd
``` 

To determine your current working directory you can either look at the part of the terminal which displays it or you can use the command `pwd` (print working directory). Enter the following command:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
pwd
``` 

In this case it will not show a __"\~"__  but the full path of your home directory. E.g. __"/pub39/tea/nsc006/"__. 

- The first __"/"__ is the root of the system. Every directory, subdirectory, file and program of the machine is within the root.
- __"pub39/"__: A directory within the root.
- __"tea/"__: A subdirectory of __"pub39/"__ and a sub-subdirectory of the root (__"/"__).
- __"nsc006"__: The home directory of user nsc006. It is a subdirectory of __"tea/"__ which is a subdirectory of __"pub39/"__ which is a subdirectory of the root (__"/"__).

### Copying 
Now that we are in our home directory we can copy the data we need to it.

To do this we can use the command `cp`. This command is followed by the directory/file we want to copy then by the directory we want to copy it to. 

To copy a directory we need to add the option `-r` which means recursively copy this directory and all its contents. Otherwise `cp` can only be used to copy files.

Use the below command to copy the workshop data to your current directory. The __"."__ refers to your current directory.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cp -r /pub39/tea/matthew/NEOF/CGR_Linux/ .
``` 

Now change directory into your newly copied directory.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd CGR_Linux
``` 

Print to screen the path of your current working directory.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
pwd
``` 

## Directory structure
You can think of the directory structure in two different ways.

### The Directory tree
This starts as the root (__"/"__) which branches out into directories and files. Directories contain files and subdirectories which contain files and subdirectories etc.

Below is an example of visualising the location of the __"CGR_Linux"__ directory within the user ncs006’s home directory as a tree. This only includes a subset of directories.
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '100%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/linux_tree_structure.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

### Boxes
Another analogy to the directory structure is boxes and items. In this case there is one large box that contains all the boxes and items, this is the root (__"/"__). In the root are items and boxes which hold items and boxes etc.

Below is an example of visualising the location of the __"CGR_Linux"__ directory within the user ncs006’s home directory as boxes. This only includes a subset of directories.
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '60%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/linux_box_structure.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

## Paths
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/paths.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
On the command line directories and files are referred to by paths e.g. __"/pub39/tea/matthew/CGR_Linux/"__ is a path.

Paths are case sensitive. The path __"directory/file.txt"__ is different than __"diRectory/File.txt"__.

Spaces should always be avoided in path names. It is highly recommended to __"\_"__ instead. This is because spaces are used to separate options and parameters in commands.

There are multiple ways to refer to a path. The two main ways are through __absolute paths__ and __relative paths__.

### Absolute paths
Absolute paths are paths that start from the root e.g.

- __"/pub39/tea/matthew/teaching/CGR_Linux/"__
- __"~/CGR_Linux/"__ (In this case ~ is a shortcut which includes the root)
- __"/pub39/tea/nsc006/file.txt"__

### Relative paths
Relative paths are paths that are relative to another location besides the root e.g.

- __"."__ (This means the current working directory).
- __".."__ (This refers to one directory up e.g. if the current directory was __"/pub39/nsc006/"__, the __".."__ directory would be __"/pub39/"__).
- __"1_directory/"__, would refer to the directory __"1_directory/"__ in your current directory

### Change directory examples
Below is a subset of valid methods to change directory into your __"CGR_Linux/"__ directory

__Note__:change __nscxxx__ to your specific user name as shown on the command line prompt.

Method 1
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd /pub39/tea/nscxxx/CGR_Linux/
``` 
Method 2
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd ~
cd CGR_Linux/
``` 
Method 3
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd /pub39/tea/nscxxx/CGR_Linux/1_directory/
cd ..
``` 
Method 4
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd /pub39/
cd tea/
cd nscxxx/
cd CGR_Linux/
``` 

## Listing Directory content
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/List.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 
To list the contents (files and directories) within a directory you can use the `ls` command. 

The output of `ls` will include file names that are coloured black and directory names that are coloured blue in our VNC terminals.

Before carrying out the below commands make sure you are in your __"CGR_Linux"__ directory with the `pwd` command.

List the contents in your current directory:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls
``` 

List the contents in your home directory:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls ..
``` 

List the contents in the root directory and put each separate file/directory on a separate line. In the below command the `-1` is a parameter that indicates there will be only 1 piece of content on each line. Note: `-2`, `-3` etc are not parameters that work with `ls`.
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ls -1 /
``` 
__Reminder__: you can use the `man` command to look at more options for commands.
