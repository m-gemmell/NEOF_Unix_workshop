It is followed by the directory you want to change to.\n-   **\"\\~\"** represents your home directory.\n\nChange directory to your home directory by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n```{bash eval=FALSE}\ncd ~ \n```\n\nIn Linux the default of `cd` is to change directory to your home directory. Therefore the following command will do the same as the above.\n\n```{bash eval=FALSE}\ncd\n```\n\nTo determine your current working directory you can either look at the part of the terminal which displays it or you can use the command `pwd` (print working directory). Enter the following command:\n\n```{bash eval=FALSE}\npwd\n```\n\nIn this case it will not show a **\"\\~\"** but the full path of your home directory. E.g. **\"/pub14/tea/nsc206/\"**.\n\n-   The first **\"/\"** is the root of the system. Every directory, subdirectory, file and program of the machine is within the root.\n-   **\"pub14/\"**: A directory within the root.\n-   **\"tea/\"**: A subdirectory of **\"pub14/\"** and a sub-subdirectory of the root (**\"/\"**).\n-   **\"nsc206\"**: The home directory of user nsc206. It is a subdirectory of **\"tea/\"** which is a subdirectory of **\"pub14/\"** which is a subdirectory of the root (**\"/\"**).\n\n### Copying\n\nNow that we are in our home directory we can copy the data we need to it.\n\nTo do this we can use the command `cp`. This command is followed by the directory/file we want to copy then by the directory we want to copy it to.\n\nTo copy a directory we need to add the option `-r` which means recursively copy this directory and all its contents. Otherwise `cp` can only be used to copy files.\n\nUse the below command to copy the workshop data to your current directory. The **\".\"** refers to your current directory.\n\n```{bash eval=FALSE}\ncp -r /pub14/tea/nsc206/NEOF/Linux/ .\n```\n\nNow change directory into your newly copied directory.\n\n```{bash eval=FALSE}\ncd Linux\n```\n\nPrint to screen the path of your current working directory.\n\n```{bash eval=FALSE}\npwd\n```\n\n## Directory structure\n\nYou can think of the directory structure in two different ways.\n\n### The Directory tree\n\nThis starts as the root (**\"/\"**) which branches out into directories and files. Directories contain files and subdirectories which contain files and subdirectories etc.\n\nBelow is an example of visualising the location of the **\"Linux\"** directory within the user ncs006's home directory as a tree. This only includes a subset of directories.\n\n```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '100%', echo=FALSE }\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"figures/linux_tree_structure.png\", auto_pdf = TRUE)\n```\n\n### Boxes\n\nAnother analogy to the directory structure is boxes and items. In this case there is one large box that contains all the boxes and items, this is the root (**\"/\"**). In the root are items and boxes which hold items and boxes etc.\n\nBelow is an example of visualising the location of the **\"Linux\"** directory within the user ncs006's home directory as boxes. This only includes a subset of directories.\n\n```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '60%', echo=FALSE }\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"figures/linux_box_structure.png\", auto_pdf = TRUE)\n```\n\n## Paths\n\n```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"figures/paths.png\", auto_pdf = TRUE)\n```\n\nOn the command line directories and files are referred to by paths e.g. **\"/pub14/tea/nsc206/Linux/\"** is a path.\n\nPaths are case sensitive. The path **\"directory/file.txt\"** is different than **\"diRectory/File.txt\"**.\n\nSpaces should always be avoided in path names. It is highly recommended to **\"\\_\"** instead. This is because spaces are used to separate options and parameters in commands.\n\nThere are multiple ways to refer to a path. The two main ways are through **absolute paths** and **relative paths**.\n\n### Absolute paths\n\nAbsolute paths are paths that start from the root e.g.\n\n-   **\"/pub14/tea/nsc206/Linux/\"**\n-   **\"\\~/Linux/\"** (In this case \\~ is a shortcut which includes the root)\n-   **\"/pub14/tea/nsc206/file.txt\"**\n\n### Relative paths\n\nRelative paths are paths that are relative to another location besides the root e.g.\n\n-   **\".\"** (This means the current working directory).\n-   **\"..\"** (This refers to one directory up e.g. if the current directory was **\"/pub14/tea/nsc206/\"**, the **\"..\"** directory would be **\"/pub14/tea/\"**).\n-   **\"1_directory/\"**, would refer to the directory **\"1_directory/\"** in your current directory\n\n### Change directory examples\n\nBelow is a subset of valid methods to change directory into your **\"Linux/\"** directory\n\n**Note**:change **nsc2xx** to your specific user name as shown on the command line prompt.\n\nMethod 1\n\n```{bash eval=FALSE}\ncd /pub14/tea/nsc2xx/Linux/\n```\n\nMethod 2\n\n```{bash eval=FALSE}\ncd ~\ncd Linux/\n```\n\nMethod 3\n\n```{bash eval=FALSE}\ncd /pub14/tea/nsc2xx/Linux/1_directory/\ncd ..\n```\n\nMethod 4\n\n```{bash eval=FALSE}\ncd /pub14/\ncd tea/\ncd nsc2xx/\ncd Linux/\n```\n\n## Listing Directory content\n\n```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"figures/List.png\", auto_pdf = TRUE)\n```\n\nTo list the contents (files and directories) within a directory you can use the `ls` command.\n\nThe output of `ls` will include file names that are coloured black and directory names that are coloured blue in our VNC terminals.\n\nBefore carrying out the below commands make sure you are in your **\"Linux\"** directory with the `pwd` command.\n\nList the contents in your current directory:\n\n```{bash eval=FALSE}\nls\n```\n\nList the contents in your home directory:\n\n```{bash eval=FALSE}\nls ..\n```\n\nList the contents in the root directory and put each separate file/directory on a separate line. In the below command the `-1` is a parameter that indicates there will be only 1 piece of content on each line. Note: `-2`, `-3` etc are not parameters that work with `ls`.\n\n```{bash eval=FALSE}\nls -1 /\n```\n\n**Reminder**: you can use the `man` command to look at more options for commands.\n\n`ls` is my most typed command. I am consistently using it to see what directories and files are in my current directory and other directories. I suggest you do the same.\n\n## MCQs: Files & Directories\n\n```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"figures/question_bubble.png\", auto_pdf = TRUE)\n```\n\nPlease attempt to answer the below Multiple-Choice Questions to reinforce what you have learnt in this chapter.\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\nopts_p <- c(\"__`cp`__\", \"__`cd`__\", answer=\"__`ls`__\")\n```\n\n1.
