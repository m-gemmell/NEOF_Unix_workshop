Header for fastq entry known as the fastq header. This always begins with a ‘@’.  \n2. Sequence content of sequence  \n3. Quality header. Always begins with a ‘+’. Sometimes also contains the same information as fastq header.  \n4. Quality values for each base in the 2nd line. NOTE: ‘@’ can be used as quality values.\n\nFor more information on the fastq format the below resource is good:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format\n",
