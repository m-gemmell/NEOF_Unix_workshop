I would highly suggest using Mamba for this purpose.\n\nMamba is a reimplementation of conda. It is a great tool for installing bioinformatic packages including R packages.\n\nMamba github: <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>\n\nThe best way to use Mamba is to install Miniforge. It has both Conda and Mamba commands.\n\nMiniforge installation: <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>\n\nMamba guide: <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html>",
