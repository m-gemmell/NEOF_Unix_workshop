## Mamba installation {#mamba_install}

Once you start using bioinformatic tools you will notice that a lot of installing is required. I would highly suggest using Mamba for this purpose.

Mamba is a reimplementation of conda. It is a great tool for installing bioinformatic packages including R packages.

The best way to use Mamba is to install Miniforge. It has both Conda and Mamba commands.
